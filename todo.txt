TODO

use sprite shape to make jagged terrain

spacebar to dash

lander damage and health
-big collisions -> more damage
-game over if health == 0

sonic waves that push lander and asteroids

atmospheric wind that pushes lander

screen shake on collision (and dash)

structure of scenes
-title screen
-intro/lore scene
-asteroid field scene - reduced gravity, more asteroids and comets and focus on evasion
-planet landing scene - more gravity, more sonic waves and wind and focus on precision
-upgrade scene

random terrain generation

random asteroid re-generation when offscreen

random asteroid shapes
-asteroids chunk off and decrease in size naturally

UI elements
-altitude
-speed
-lander hologram visualization
  -current health/damaged parts
  -fuel here

-damaged parts of the lander affect movement? (rotation, thrust, inertia, mass?)

red flashing light on lander when low health

detect safe landing (on lander's legs) and SUCCESS!

small dash when first turning on thruster

thruster flame (and dash a lot) applies a force to asteroids and pushes them away

make music!

make SFX!

camera frames the action (incoming asteroids, waves, where the lander is facing, etc.)

camera will zoom out and stop moving when reaching the terrain (the terrain is always the bottom of the camera's vision)
